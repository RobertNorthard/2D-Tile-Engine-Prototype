2D-Tile-Engine Prototype

The purpose of the 2D Tile Engine is to provide basic methods for drawing and manipulating a 2D tile map.

Used in games:

‘Killcraft’ is a single-player 2-Dimensional tile-based engine. The player controls a sprite, in a non-persistently 
timed single-player world. The game houses two game modes, creative and survival. Creative mode allows the player to
place blocks, known as tiles, in any permutation possible. The games objectives have similarities with that of 
‘Minecraft’ and ‘Terraria’. Likewise my game focuses on creativity; by placing various tiles the player can build a 
world to their taste. 

Shooting fireballs at enemies is the games survival mode primary objective. For each enemy 
destroyed, a new one spawns, with an increased field-of-view and health. The player has thirty-seconds to obliterate 
as many enemies possible. If the player collides with an enemy then the player’s health is reduced, once hit zero, 
game over! The player’s score is then saved onto a high-score board.
